Thank you for downloading!
\n
This personal project was to help alleviate resource management in-game to keep tabs on my Cabal Points and Ritual Costs.
\n
Top right of this screen is a button to add a unit to your army. Swipe the unit for options to edit or delete it.
Top left will open a side bar to add points from Tzaangor's and Helbrute's ability.
If your army has Ahriman or a unit that holds Lord of Forbidden Lore, swipe on a ritual in the ritual tab to access their abilities.
